# PageFolio
This project is not yet completed, and at present has been paused. Below is an explanation of what problem it is designed to solve.

## What is PageFolio?
**In short, PageFolio is a simple way of showing off who you are by building a hub of information, combined with customisation, without the expensive overhead of a website.**

Small businesses, content creators, professionals, etc, have a unique challenge when it comes to building an online presence. They want to be able to display who they are, what they do, and contact information. There are three ways they may consider to do this:

- Set up a website. However, this is expensive, with some providers (on the lower end) costing around £100 a year for a functional website. There’s also a lot of maintenance and fussing around to get the website looking how they want. This takes a lot of time.

- Set up a social media page. It is hard for a business (and even more so a professional) to display what they do using posts. Posts should be used to display updates to customers, but it is very hard to use them to display a portfolio of products or services; or to show contact information. The only static information they can show is their bio.

- Use a link-in-bio tool. These offer very limited customisation options, they simply display a list of links and after about 5 links it is impossible to understand anything. It is not possible to display content about what services and products are available, as link-in-bio tools require a link to be added to another page where this information is displayed. 

Setting up a website is expensive; social media is too dynamic to display static information; and link-in-bio tools allow minimal information to be shown and have a poor user experience.

PageFolio could be a simple one-page website builder combined with social media. Small businesses and professionals could use the platform to display information about themselves as a cheaper alternative to a website, yet it is as easy to set up as an Instagram account.

Where this is different from link-in-bio tools like Linktree is that PageFolio is about displaying brand information not just links. While Linktree acts as a hub with different links to social platforms or sites; PageFolio acts as a hub for information. On their page people don’t just put a link to their Instagram page; they put a description of who they are; what they do; pictures of products or services; contact information.

As time goes on, it may even be possible to introduce interactivity to these PageFolios. Contact forms that save contact information; push notifications of announcements to users who are “watching the space”; analytics of users and interactivity. These could even be made part of a cheap premium plan.
